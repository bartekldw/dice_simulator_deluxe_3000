# 🎲 Dice Simulator Deluxe 3000™

Ever wondered if your dice are secretly biased?  
Woke up at 3AM thinking: *“What if the number 6 is cheating?”*  
Well... same.

Welcome to the **Dice Simulator Deluxe 3000™** — the only C++ program you'll ever need  
to generate completely useless, yet weirdly satisfying fake dice stats.

###  What does this thing do?

- Asks you how many sides your epic gamer dice has (yes, D20s are welcome).
- Asks how many times to roll it (the more, the spicier the data).
- Generates a beautiful terminal bar chart with asterisk magic 
- Highlights the most rolled number in blazing red 
- Uses proper C++ random engines — no `rand()` shenanigans here.

###  Why?

Because why not?  
And also: practice, pain, and plotting my future dice empire.

###  Disclaimer
This project won't help you pass math, fix your code, or get you a girlfriend.
But hey, it's got a colorful graph — and that's something.

### How to run it

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o dice_simulator_main.cpp.cpp
